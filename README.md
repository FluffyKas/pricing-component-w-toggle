## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this challenge to learn about toggle switches and some accessibility concerns that come with them. As it turned out when doing research, there's a lot more to this topic than I originally thought. Sara Soueidan's [article](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/toggle-switch-design/) is a great read, and it helped me understand what needs to be taken into consideration when designing toggle switches and what semantic elements we may choose depending on the context. Then I followed one of her recommendations and checked out a [codepen](https://codepen.io/scottohara/pen/zLZwNv) from Scott O'Hara to see how this gets implemented. I ended up using his code and tweaking it a bit for my project. The markup is very straightforward, most of the actual toggle is being implemented by some pseudo-elements.
